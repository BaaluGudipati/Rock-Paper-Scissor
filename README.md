# Rock-Paper-Scissor
To build the Rock, Paper, Scissors game, I began by implementing the basic gameplay, where the player selects either Rock, Paper, or Scissors, and the computer randomly chooses one as well. The game then compares both choices to determine the winner based on the rules: Rock beats Scissors, Scissors beats Paper, and Paper beats Rock. If both players make the same choice, it’s a tie.

Once the basic functionality was in place, I enhanced the game by adding difficulty levels for the AI. In the easy mode, the computer randomly selects a choice. In medium mode, the AI analyzes the player’s previous choices and tries to counter the most frequent one. For hard mode, the computer predicts the player’s next move by tracking patterns in their previous choices. These difficulty levels provide a more challenging and dynamic experience for the player, making the game more engaging.

I also introduced multiplayer functionality, allowing two players to compete against each other instead of just playing against the AI. This adds more variety and fun to the game, especially for those who prefer playing with friends.

Additionally, I added a feature to track the winning and losing streaks of the player. This creates a competitive element where players try to maintain a winning streak, which adds excitement and motivation to keep playing. The streaks are displayed throughout the game, so players can monitor their progress.

In terms of design, I used simple loops, conditional statements, and randomization techniques to build the core logic of the game. The streak tracking and AI behavior add complexity while enhancing the overall user experience.

By combining basic game mechanics with additional features like difficulty modes, multiplayer options, and streak tracking, I created a more enjoyable and competitive Rock, Paper, Scissors game. This project demonstrates my ability to build interactive applications, implement both simple and complex logic, and create a fun, engaging user experience
